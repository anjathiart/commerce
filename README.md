# commerce

A Python Django auction site website similar to bid-or-buy (but much simpler). This project forms part of CS50 Web 2020.

This project is deliberatly done without any javascript. 

## Notes

1. In hindsight 'bid' and 'comment' models should have a foreign key relationship to 'listing', because a bid and / or a comment cannot share more than one listing.
2. Error / exception handling has not been implemented extensively.
